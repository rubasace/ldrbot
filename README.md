## ℹ️ About LDRBot

**LDRBot** stands for **LinkedIn Daily (games) Rankings Bot** — a Telegram bot that automates score tracking and leaderboard generation
for [LinkedIn’s daily puzzle games](https://www.linkedin.com/games) (currently, [Queens](https://www.linkedin.com/games/queens), [Tango](https://www.linkedin.com/games/tango),
and [Zip](https://www.linkedin.com/games/zip)).

Each Telegram group becomes its own independent competition; Members submit their puzzle results by uploading screenshots, and LDRBot uses OCR to extract solving times and build a
daily ranking automatically.

## 🦾 Try It Out

Add LDRBot to your Telegram group: [@ldrbot](https://t.me/LinkedinDailyRankingBot)

Each group is treated as a standalone competition — just invite the bot to your group and you’re ready to go!

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you add LDRBot to a Telegram group, that group becomes its own independent leaderboard and competition space. Each day, members of the group can submit their results for
LinkedIn’s puzzles (currently: Queens, Tango, and Zip) by simply uploading a screenshot of their completion screen.

LDRBot automatically scans these screenshots using OCR (powered by OpenCV and Tesseract) and extracts the relevant information: the game type and the time it took to solve it. Once
processed, your time is recorded for the current day and associated with your Telegram user ID.

As group members submit their scores, LDRBot keeps track of who’s already participated and waits for everyone to submit. Once all registered players have sent their times, it
automatically recalculates and publishes the daily leaderboard. Alternatively, any member can run the /daily command to manually trigger a recalculation at any time.

If not everyone submits, LDRBot will still calculate and publish the results at the end of the day, including only the times that were received. This ensures the competition
continues smoothly even if someone forgets to post their score.

Each group maintains its own isolated set of scores, players, and competition history — meaning users can participate in multiple groups independently. Leaderboards reset daily, so
every new day is a fresh challenge for members to compete, improve, and (hopefully) brag.

> [!NOTE]
> Only **group messages** with commands or screenshots are processed.  
> Private message support is under development.

## 🖼️ Screenshots

LDRBot uses OCR to read your submitted screenshots and extract the game and solving time.  
For best results, try to capture the colored square that shows the game result (e.g., ZIP, TANGO, or QUEENS) **as clearly as possible**, and avoid overlays like confetti or cropped
images.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- A Telegram account
- A Telegram group where you have permission to add bots

### Setup

1. **Add the bot to your group**  
   LDRBot will start tracking scores and players from the moment it's added.

2. **Run `/join` (optional)**  
   Registers you manually. Optional as it happens automatically when you send any message on the tracked group.

3. **Submit your LinkedIn score screenshot**  
   LDRBot will extract your time and game, and track it for the day.

4. **Manage your score (optional)**  
   Use `/delete`, `/deleteall`, or `/override` (admin-only) to modify the results if needed. Useful for correcting misprocessed or mistaken submissions.

5. **Watch the leaderboard evolve**  
   Once everyone submits (or at day’s end), LDRBot will post the updated rankings.
